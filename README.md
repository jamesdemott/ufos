# UFO Read Me

**Overview of the Annalysis**
The purpose of my work here was to present a static set of data on the web using HTML. By utilizing our HTML and javascript skills, I have successfully produced code that presents this static data in an attractive format and allows the user to input criteria and have a list of results returned which satisfy the input criteria. 

**Results** 
To perform a search, simply input the desired criteria and the code will return the filtered list.

**Summary**
The drawbacks of the website are that some of the comments have not been properly reformatted and there are some irregularieties with the spellings of some of the comment strings. Additionally, the website is currently not deployed as a github website and thus needs to be downloaded and run in visual studio.
